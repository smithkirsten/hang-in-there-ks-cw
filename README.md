# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
This webpage allows a user to generate randomly-combined motivational posters using a combination of quotes, images, and titles so that they can experience for themselves the incredible levels of motivation felt by cubicle workers in the early 2000s. Users can also create their own posters using their own images, titles and quotes. They can save any of these posters into a grid, and keep that grid organized by deleting posters as desired. 

### Installation Instructions:

This app can be cloned to a local device via github by using the command "git clone git@github.com:smithkirsten/hang-in-there-ks-cw.git" in terminal. Then the folder must be opened using a tool such as VS Code. From there, the URL for the main.js file can be dragged and dropped from VS Code into the a chrome browser, where it will function as webpage. 

### Preview of App:

### Context:

We have worked on this project every morning from 6 am to 9 am MDT, plus several hours most evenings over the past 5 days, for a total of about 24 hours of work per person. We are starting week three of Turing tomorrow.

### Learning Goals:

*Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data.

*Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword.

*Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM.

*Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

We worked with VS Code, terminal, and a number of new-to-us JS concepts such as query selectors, event listeners, anonynmous functions, event.target.id methods, and more familiar methods such as arrays, strings, objects, and classes. 

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: We were able to stick with the DTR that we'd agreed on. We finished the project. We are starting to understand how to use new concepts like event listeners and query selectors. 

Challenges: Having not yet been introduced to the concepts of event targeting at the onset of this project we wasted a lot of time trying to conceptualize this ourselves because we didn't have the underlying framework to productively search some of the specifics that were required of us in this project.
